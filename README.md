## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Configure NOVA Compute Node
Set up the NOVA compute node on OpenStack to manage virtual machine instances. Detailed setup steps and prerequisites are included.

### Exercise 2: Configure Swift Object Storage
Configure Swift, OpenStackâ€™s object storage service, which enables scalable and redundant storage of data across clusters.

### Exercise 3: Construct a Cinder Block Node
Build a Cinder Block Storage Node for OpenStack to provide block storage for virtual instances. This involves database configuration, service credential setup, and endpoint creation.

### Exercise 4: Build a Horizon Node
Install and configure the OpenStack dashboard, known as Horizon, to monitor and manage cloud resources.

### Exercise 5: Launching an Instance
Instructions for launching a virtual machine instance in OpenStack, including key pair setup, security groups, and instance configuration.

### Exercise 6: Sharing Project Environment
Share project resources and environments with multiple users. This exercise covers user management, role assignment, and project configurations in OpenStack.

## Prerequisites

Each exercise requires:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the operating system.
- An OpenStack environment set up with necessary modules.
- Access to OpenStack CLI for administrative tasks.
